    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="description">A hamburger, also called a burger, is a dish consisting of fillings—usually a patty of ground meat,
        typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. The patties are often served with cheese,
        lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon or chilis with condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise,
        relish or a "special sauce", often a variation of Thousand Island dressing and are frequently placed on
        sesame seed buns. A hamburger patty topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li class="ingredients">2 red apples, cored (such as Fuji, Gala, or Pink Lady)</li>
        <li class="ingredients">1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li class="ingredients">1/4 cup fine dry breadcrumbs</li>
        <li class="ingredients">1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons chili crisp, divided, plus more for serving </li>
        <li class="ingredients">1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li class="ingredients">2 (1/3-inch) slices red onion</li>
        <li class="ingredients">4 hamburger buns</li>
        <li class="ingredients">1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li class="steps">Slice 1 apple using a mandoline slicer to create 8 (1/4-inch-thick) slices. Shred any remaining scraps plus
            all or part of the second apple to get 1/2 cup shredded apple. Squeeze shredded apple to extract some of the
            moisture. Reserve any remaining apple for another use. </li>
        <li class="steps">Preheat an outdoor grill to medium heat (350 to 375 degrees F (175 to 190 degrees C)).

        </li>
        <li class="steps">Combine ground beef, breadcrumbs, 1 tablespoon chili crisp, salt, and the 1/2 cup shredded apple in a bowl.
            Shape into 4 (1/2-inch-thick) patties, 4 inches in diameter. Mixture may be wet so be sure to tightly pack
            patties.
        </li>
        <li class="steps">Oil the grill grate. Grill patties, covered, carefully turning halfway through, until an instant-read
            thermometer inserted into centers of patties reads 160 degrees F (71 degrees C), 10 to 13 minutes. Grill
            onion slices, turning halfway through, 8 to 10 minutes. Grill apple slices, turning halfway through, 4 to 5
            minutes. If you like, grill buns, cut sides down, until toasted, 1 to 2 minutes. When onions are cool enough
            to handle, separate rings.
        </li>
        <li class="steps">Stir mayonnaise and remaining 2 teaspoons chili crisp together in a small bowl. Spread buns with mayonnaise
            mixture and fill with patties, onion, and apple slices. Serve with additional chili crisp
        </li>
    </ol>
